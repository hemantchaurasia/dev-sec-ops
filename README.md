# DevSecOps

### DevSecOps environment:

**Developers**
 - Developers should be familiar with security vulnerabilities and be able to fix any issues that are discovered during the development process.
 - Selecting secure coding practices
 - Integrating security testing into the CI/CD pipeline
   
**Operations** 
- Responsible for deploying, monitoring, and maintaining the infrastructure and applications. 
- Monitoring for suspicious activity and responding to security incidents. 
- Operations teams should also implement security best practices, such as access control and monitoring 
- Use automation to ensure that the system is secure and compliant.

**Security Professionals** 
- Security professionals are responsible for identifying, assessing, and mitigating security risks.  
- Security professionals should also conduct regular security assessments and audits to identify vulnerabilities and assess the effectiveness of existing security measures.
- Work closely with developers and operations teams to integrate security into the development process and ensure that the system is secure at all times.

### DevSecOps key principles and practices:

- **Automation:** Automation plays a vital role in DevSecOps, enabling the rapid and consistent deployment of security controls and measures. It includes automated security testing, vulnerability scanning, code analysis, configuration management, and security monitoring.

- **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** DevSecOps embraces CI/CD practices, ensuring that security checks and tests are seamlessly integrated into the continuous integration and deployment pipelines. Security scans, code analysis, and other security measures are performed automatically at each stage, providing rapid feedback and early detection of vulnerabilities.

- **Shift-Left Security:** DevSecOps promotes addressing security early in the SDLC, starting from the design and development phases. Security considerations, threat modeling, and secure coding practices are incorporated into the development process, reducing the likelihood of introducing vulnerabilities later.

- **Collaboration and Communication:** DevSecOps emphasizes cross-functional collaboration and communication among development, operations, and security teams. Regular interaction and shared responsibility enable the identification and resolution of security issues throughout the development lifecycle.

- **Security as Code:** Treating security measures as code allows for version control, automation, and repeatability. Security controls, configurations, and policies are defined as code and integrated into the deployment process, ensuring consistent and auditable security practices.

- **Continuous Monitoring and Feedback:** DevSecOps includes ongoing monitoring of applications and infrastructure to detect and respond to security incidents and anomalies. Security logs, metrics, and alerts are continuously monitored, providing valuable feedback for improving security measures.
